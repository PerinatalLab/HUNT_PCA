## HUNT Principal Components Analysis

Project PC calculated from HapMap III onto HUNT, and calculate PC in HUNT. HUNT QC previously done. 





## Scripts
1. `extract_mom_samples.R` to drop boring phenotypes (medications...)
2. `hunt_geno_range.R` to wget all the rest, and filter p<1e-5


## Process

1. Extract list of HUNT maternal samples and genotyped variants (chr and pos)
2. Download HapMap III data and run PC in overlapping genetic variants with HUNT
3.
